# coviddetection_xray

You can detect whether a person is infected by COVID-19 or not with the help of Xray of Lungs. 
This can prevent the pollution generated due to printed X-Ray sheets as the Doctor just need to click the image of patient's lungs/chest and upload it into the model and it will give us out the results stating whether a person is a Covid patient or not.
